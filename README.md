# SMS-Heroes-of-the-Lance
This is an in progress disassembly of the Sega Master System game Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes of the Lance.
I try to comment the code as much as possible, and learn about the inner workings, and maybe modify the game a bit.
Currently, the game reassembles, and playable, but obviously as I work on it, sometimes it gets uploaded broken, or otherwise in an unworkable state. It won't get assembled to exactly how the original ROM was.
The comments may not always make sense, they are more like a guide for me not to forget where I left off.
Anyways, this is only for educational and learning purposes, not to make any profit or anything.
